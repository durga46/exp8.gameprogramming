## Aim:
To Create a landscape, add foliage, apply landscape material

## Procedure:

1.	Create a landscape in the blueprint:

•	Open the blueprint editor or 3D modeling software of your choice.
•	Create a terrain mesh to represent the landscape.
•	Sculpt the terrain to create hills, valleys, and other desired features.
2.	Add foliage:
•	Create an array or layer for the foliage.
•	Select suitable foliage assets such as trees, bushes, or flowers.
•	Scatter the foliage assets across the landscape, considering natural placement and variation.
3.	Apply landscape material:
•	Create an array or layer blend for the landscape materials.
•	Create Layer 1 for soil:
•	Select a soil texture or material and apply it to the layer.
•	Adjust the tiling, roughness, and other parameters to achieve the desired appearance.
•	Create Layer 2 for rocks:
•	Select a rock texture or material and apply it to the layer.
•	Adjust the tiling, roughness, and other parameters as needed.
•	Create Layer 3 for grass:
•	Select a grass texture or material and apply it to the layer.
•	Adjust the tiling, roughness, and other parameters as desired.
4.	Add a 3D house model:
•	Import or create a 3D model of a house.
•	Place the house model on the landscape in a suitable location.
•	Adjust the position, rotation, and scale of the house model to fit the scene.
5.	Add a bridge:
•	Import or create a 3D model of a bridge.
•	Position the bridge model over a water body or gap in the landscape.
•	Adjust the position, rotation, and scale of the bridge model to align it with the landscape.
6.	Apply suitable materials:
•	Select appropriate materials for the house and bridge models.
•	Apply the materials to the corresponding models, considering factors like texture, color, and reflectivity.
7.	Fine-tune and iterate:
•	Review the overall composition, materials, and placement.
•	Make adjustments as necessary to achieve the desired aesthetic and functionality.
